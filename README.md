# Tree Data Structure Project

## Overview

This project implements a generic tree data structure in C++ with customizable arity. The tree supports various traversal methods including In-order, Pre-order, Post-order, Breadth-First Search (BFS), and Depth-First Search (DFS). Additionally, the project includes visualization capabilities using the SFML library.

## Features

- **Generic Tree Implementation**: Supports customizable arity.
- **Tree Traversals**:
  - In-order (only for binary trees)
  - Pre-order (only for binary trees)
  - Post-order (only for binary trees)
  - BFS
  - DFS
  - HEAP
- **SFML Visualization**: Visualize the tree structure using the SFML library.

## Dependencies

- **SFML**: Simple and Fast Multimedia Library for visualization.
- **doctest**: Lightweight testing framework for C++.

## Usage

### Running the Game

To run the game, use the following command:

```bash
make tree
```

### Running Tests

To run tests, use the following command:

```bash
make runtests
```
### Cleaning Up Files

To delete files created during compilation and execution, use the following command:

```bash
make clean
```
